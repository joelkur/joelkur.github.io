## Introduction

The [Command-Line Tools for Linguists](https://studies.helsinki.fi/kurssit/toteutus/hy-opt-cur-2425-261401a1-c550-4436-91b9-7edf4a1a3b57/KIK-LG221)
course is an introduction to working with the terminal, from the perspective of performing tasks relevant for language technology.

It teaches the basics of using an Unix-like environment, but also teaches
* regular expressions
* running and installing programs from terminal
* shell scripting
* version control tools ([git](https://git-scm.com/) specifically)
* working with remote servers
* hosting a static website (like this) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Overall, I think it's a quite well made course that might be useful even for individuals with prior experience with Unix-like systems, like myself.
