## Introduction

The [Command-Line Tools for Linguists](https://studies.helsinki.fi/kurssit/toteutus/hy-opt-cur-2425-261401a1-c550-4436-91b9-7edf4a1a3b57/KIK-LG221)
course is an introduction to working with the terminal, from the perspective of performing tasks relevant for language technology.

It teaches the basics of using an Unix-like environment, but also teaches
* regular expressions
* running and installing programs from terminal
* shell scripting
* version control tools ([git](https://git-scm.com/) specifically)
* working with remote servers
* hosting a static website (like this) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Overall, I think it's a quite well made course that might be useful even for individuals with prior experience with Unix-like systems, like myself.

## Week 1 - Introduction to the command-line

This week was an introduction to using the command-line, focusing on how to perform the most basic computing tasks such as navigating between
directories and working with files, but in the terminal.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ls` | List contents of an directory |
| `cd` | Change directory |
| `less` | Display contents of a file |
| `cat` | Print the contents of files to the standard output |
| `wget` | Download a file over the internet |
| `touch` | Create a file |
| `mkdir` | Create directories |
| `cp` | Copy files or directories |
| `mv` | Rename or move files (or directories) |
| `rm` | Remove files or directories |

### Editing files in a terminal text editor

* [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) was the terminal text editor advised to be used in the exercises
  ```bash
  nano file.txt
  ```

* [vim](https://www.vim.org/) is another terminal text editor one could use
  ```bash
  vim file.txt
  ```

  But beware...

### What I learned
I was already quite familiar with the topics in week 1, but I used the opportunity to try out [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) on week 1.
